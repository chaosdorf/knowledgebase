# knowledgebase

This is the knowledgebase for the [Chaosdorf](https://chaosdorf.de).

This is a **test**, for replacing the [wiki](https://wiki.chaosdorf.de) (or transforming it into markdown files).

DO NOT PANIC! This might work or might might not, but It won't deprecate the wiki (at least for now). It might seem infeasable, but I'm (Emile) just giving it a try.
