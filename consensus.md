# Consensus

Rather than having a vote, we decided to go for **consensus**.

This means that we are committed to find solutions for our problems that reflect every individual needs and ideas. At our weekly meet-ups, called Plenum, we discuss propositions and document them as consensus when they are agreed upon.

To achieve this, decisions should be **prepared**. Members can access our internal wiki which contains pages for the next occurrence of the Plenum and the following one. There we collect problems and ideas to think about and discuss in advance. Ideally, our meetings see that we already agree on the proposition and accept it.

If there is need for debate, we try to understand other peoples views and to incorporate them in the proposition. This may be not enough and we decide to move the proposition to the next Plenum or take a vote.
