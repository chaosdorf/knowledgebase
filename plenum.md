# Plenum

The **Plenum** is our weekly meet-up. There, we discuss current issues and plans for the future. It occurs every **Tuesday at 20:00 h**. Proposals must be collected in advance to keep every member informed and give [consensus](consensus.md) a chance. This, as well as the minutes, are documented in the [internal Wiki](https://intern.chaosdorf.de/verein/plenum/).

course of action:

- elect a moderator and a minute taker
- everyone quickly introduces themselves
- we decide current membership proposals
- we hear reports and announcements
- we discuss and decide collected proposals
- lastly we make left-over announcements and give ideas for the next plenum

Decisions are based on consensus, but only members can give a veto and stop the process.
